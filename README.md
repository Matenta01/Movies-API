This is project is an application that provides a RESTful API for accessing a movie database. The database is a SQLite database that contains information about movies, people, and their relationships.

## Dependencies

Overall, we have the following dependencies:

- [sqllite-jdbc](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.xerial/sqlite-jdbc) - SQLite JDBC Driver
- [javalin](https://javalin.io/) - A simple web framework for Java
- [junit](https://junit.org/junit5/) - JUnit for unit testing
- [mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) - Mockito for mocking objects in unit tests
- [rest-assured](https://rest-assured.io/) - Testing and validating our APIs

These dependencies are managed by Maven, and you can find them in the [pom.xml](pom.xml) file.

## Database

### Development Database

The database is a simple SQLite database that contains information about movies, people, and their relationships and is obtained from the IMDB movies database. Its data has not been modified in any way

You can find the database in the [src/main/resources](src/main/resources) folder. The database is called `movies.db`. It won't be there until you run the project for the first time. I am using the com.googlecode.maven-download-plugin to pull the database in from a remote location. This is defined in the [pom.xml](pom.xml) file. It should be pulled when you run the project for the first time.

### Testing Database

Although the development database is simple, it has a lot of data. This can make testing difficult. For testing we use a in-memory database. This database is created and populated with data before each test and destroyed after each test. This code can be found in [src/test/java/com/flickfinder/util/Seeder.java](src/test/java/com/flickfinder/util/Seeder.java).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository address>`
2. Open the project in your favourite IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.). While you can use any IDE, these instructions will assume you are using Eclipse. The project is a Maven project; as such, the process should be similar in other IDEs.
3. In Eclipse, got to File -> Open Projects from File System... and select the root directory of the project.

4. In the package explorer, right click on the project and select Run As -> Maven Install. This will download all the dependencies and build the project, including the database.

5. If all has gone well, you should see a message in the console saying "BUILD SUCCESS". If you see this, you are ready to run the project. Ignore, any warnings or errors about JRE System Library.

6. To run the project, right click on the project in the package explorer and locate `src/main/java/com/flickfinder/Main.java`, right click on this file and select Run As -> Java Application.

7. You'll see a warning in the console: "SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder". This is not a problem and can be ignored.

8. Open a browser. Ideally one with JSON rendering capabilities (e.g.Firefox or Chrome with a JSON extension). In the address bar, type `http://localhost:8000`. If all has gone well, you should see the API documentation.
